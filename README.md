## Marius Brad

I am a driven, dedicated and energetic junior full stack developer, looking for a tech company where I can continue to learn and grow as a competent software developer. 

For the past few years I have been teaching myself to code and because writing code brings me immense personal satisfaction I decided to join Makers Academy to boost my programing knowledge. At Makers I learned about the fundamentals of OOP, TDD, BDD and best practices and methodologies when it comes to writing well tested and clean code. 

My background is in financial industry, sales and logistics where I learned to work, communicate and collaborate with people from various departments, levels and walks of life.

**Tech Stack**: Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS,  Sinatra, Rails, React, Bootstrap, Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme, Cypress

## Hobbies

The Great Outdoors - I love being surrounded by nature and experience it in all its glory. I love camping, especially camping in my De Waard tent from early spring till late in the season. Nothing compares with that feeling when you wake up in the morning in your tent surrounded by nature, either in a lovely camping site somewhere in rural France or somewhere high in the mountains.

Fitness become a hobby of mine as soon as I started to realize that probably I won't live forever as previously thought. I'm trying to train at least 3 times a week, anything from high intensity workouts like HIIT to lifting weights, rowing on my WaterRower or cycling.
