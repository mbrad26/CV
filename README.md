# Marius Brad

I am a driven, dedicated and energetic junior full stack developer, looking for a tech company where I can continue to learn and grow as a competent software developer. 

For the past few years I have been teaching myself to code and because writing code brings me immense personal satisfaction I decided to join Makers Academy to boost my programing knowledge. At Makers I learned about the fundamentals of OOP, TDD, BDD and best practices and methodologies when it comes to writing well tested and clean code. 

My background is in financial industry, sales and logistics where I learned to work, communicate and collaborate with people from various departments, levels and walks of life.

**Tech Stack**: Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS,  Sinatra, Rails, React, Bootstrap, Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme, Cypress

# Skills

#### Quick Learner
I am a hungry learner who devours information about topics of interest with passion and energy.

At Makers I taught myself Ruby on Rails in one week and used it to build, together with my team a fully tested and working clone of Facebook. 
For the end of course project I learned enough React, Cypress, Jest and Enzyme during a single weekend, to enable me to contribute in a meaningful way to my team’s project and goals. 

#### Inquisitive 
I love to learn and read about software development from all the available sources(Youtube, Medium etc). I often find myself on Google searching for new books about programming  to study from and to help me deepen my understanding.

#### Adaptable 
I have lived in five regions, in three different countries, and I met and worked with people from all backgrounds. Every change brought something new in my life, new challenges and new opportunities.

#### Collaborator 

I am a goal-oriented person that loves working with other developers to achieve a common goal.
At Makers Academy we often worked on different, challenging projects in teams and this proved to be the most valuable experience during the course. I am always comfortable finding my place in a team, actively listen to my colleagues ideas and I value open and friendly communication.

# Hobbies

The Great Outdoors - I love being surrounded by nature and experience it in all its glory. I love camping, especially camping in my De Waard tent from early spring till late in the season. Nothing compares with that feeling when you wake up in the morning in your tent surrounded by nature, either in a lovely camping site somewhere in rural France or somewhere high in the mountains.

Fitness become a hobby of mine as soon as I started to realize that probably I won't live forever as previously thought. I'm trying to train at least 3 times a week, anything from high intensity workouts, lifting weights, rowing on my WaterRower or cycling.
